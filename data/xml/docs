	token themselves (DONE)
	POS (DONE)
	binary feature indicating if the two events have the same POS tag (DONE)
	lemma

pairwise

	sentence distance (difference of the sentence number)
	event distance (difference of the event IDs, if they are adjacent the distance is 0)  (DONE)


	Event attributes
		class  (DONE)
		tense  (DONE)
		aspect (DONE)
		polarity(DONE)

		(events that are noun, adjectives or propositions dont have aspect and tense, for these you need to look at verbs that govern them using dependency relation and use their aspect and tense)

		four binary features representing whether e1 adn e2 have same event attributes or not  (DONE)

		These features (the binary ones) and tense and aspect are very important for the detection of the causal relation

	Dependency information 

		dependency path between e1 and e2
		the type of causative verb connecting them if any 
		binary features indicating whether e1 or e2 are root of the sentence

		Information is based on collapsed representation of dependency relations provided by StanfordCoreNLP

	Causal Signals 

		Causal signals between e1 and e2 or before e1. 

		Position of the signal: between or before 

		In case of multiple signals between e1 and e2, take the one closest to e2

	Temporal relations 

		the temporal relation type connecting e1 and e2 if any
