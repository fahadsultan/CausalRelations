<html><body><p>The US government recently announced new regulations designed to change the way transplant organs are made available to sick patients . Under the new guidelines , donor organs will be made available to the sickest people first , wherever they live in the country . Currently , transplant organs are rationed through a regional system of distribution . The private group that runs the current system , United Network for Organ Sharing , or UNOS , objects to the new regulations . UNOS says the regulations put the federal government in charge of deciding who gets transplants and that many hospital transplant centers would be forced to close . Health and Human Services Secretary Do - Donna Shalala says patients who need an organ transplant should not have to take a chance that an organ will become available in their local area , nor should patients have to travel to transplant centers far from their homes to improve their chances of getting an organ . UNOS spokeswoman Donna Henry Wright says the new policy would not necessarily be more <span style='background:yellow'>fair</span> or <span style='background:silver'>effective</span> because allowances are already <span style='background:silver'><span style='background:yellow'>made</span></span> for the most needy patients . The sickest patients are already treated first . There are not huge waiting uh disparit - waiting time disparities amongst the very uh sickest patients . It 's between two to six days for every one uh of the sickest patients across the country . um So it 's a - it 's a fallacy that they 're <span style='background:lightblue'>doing</span> this because um the sickest patients are n't being <span style='background:lightblue'>served</span> . Doctor James Burdick , the Professor of Transplant Surgery at Johns Hopkins University Hospital in Baltimore , Maryland , and former President of UNOS , said the current system has evolved over several years and it works well . You may , in a year or two , save a few more lives if you do sickest first . But the number of patients waiting then begins to increase , um and , in fact , um over the years many more patients who are about to die of liver tra - uh without a liver transplant would accumulate . If you do the uh alternative extreme , you do n't save as many lives in the early years , by a small fraction . Our system is balanced , it 's right in the middle . And , therefore , it works very well . Nationwide , there are about ten thousand patients waiting for liver transplants each year and only four thousand organs become available for transplants . Secretary Shalala says UNOS five months ago , or gave them five months to develop a new plan to distribute livers which are in the shortest supply . This is VOA Today .</p></body></html>
