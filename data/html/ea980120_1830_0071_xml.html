<html><body><p>Good evening from the central park in downtown Havana . We are here this week to witness the rendezvous that Fidel Castro and the Pope are having with history . We are <span style='background:yellow'>here</span> because what happens on this island will also have an <span style='background:yellow'>impact</span> on the United States . Everything that happens in Cuba gets America 's attention . Incidentally , we just show up to do the broadcast , and Cubans want to know what we 're going to tell Americans , in many cases , what their relatives in the United States are going to hear . Well , this is the eve of the Pope 's <span style='background:silver'>visit</span> to one of the last bastions of Communism anywhere in the world , and it is already causing enormous <span style='background:silver'>expectations</span> . In Revolution Square , they put up a giant cross today . And right across from the Cuban revolutionary icon Che Guevara , they now have a giant portrait of Jesus . Above it in Spanish , Jesus , in you we believe . Not all Cubans believe , but Castro has <span style='background:lightblue'>invited</span> everyone to welcome the man who has been one of Communism 's most effective adversaries , and that 's why there is <span style='background:lightblue'>suspense</span> . Everyone appears to believe that somehow Cuba is going to change . Castro has said officially that it 's okay to be enthusiastic . And so , people are increasingly enthusiastic by today , Cuban television , which clings to the Communist Party line , actually began to promote its papal coverage . Today , hundreds of people from the US began to arrive , including some Cuban Americans who left here when Castro came to power and are returning to Havana for the first time . The Pope 's visit is important , but they are also coming home . This is quite an extraordinary story unfolding here . We 'll come back to Havana later in the broadcast . But now we 're going to go back to New York , where Diane Sawyer has the rest of the news . Diane ?</p></body></html>
