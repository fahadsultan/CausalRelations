A spokeswoman for Crum amp Forster said employees were told early this week that numerous staff functions for the personal insurance lines were going to be centralized as a cost-cutting move . She said the <span style='background:yellow'>move</span> would result in a after-tax <span style='background:yellow'>charge</span> of less than $ 4 million to be spread over the next three quarters . By comparison , for the first nine months , Xerox earned $ 492 million , or $ 4.55 a share , on revenue of $ 12.97 billion .
