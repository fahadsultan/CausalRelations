The <span style='background:yellow'>move</span> boosts Intelogic Chairman Asher Edelman 's stake to 20 % from 16.2 % and may help prevent Martin Ackerman from <span style='background:yellow'>making</span> a run at the computer-services concern . Mr. Ackerman already is seeking to oust Mr. Edelman as chairman of Datapoint Corp., an Intelogic affiliate . The action followed by one day an Intelogic announcement that it will retain an investment banker to explore alternatives " to maximize shareholder value , " including the possible sale of the company . In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , Intelogic shares rose 37.5 cents to close at $ 2.75 . Mr. Edelman declined to specify what prompted the recent moves , saying they are meant only to benefit shareholders when " the company is on a roll . " He added , " This has nothing to do with Marty Ackerman and it is not designed , particularly , to take the company private . " But Mr. Ackerman said the buy-back , and the above-market price paid , prove that Mr. Edelman is running scared .</p><h3>Causal Relations                 with events defined as verb or nouns (Mirza's work):</h3><table border="1" class="dataframe">
