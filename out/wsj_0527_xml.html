In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange Friday , Crossland closed at $ 5.25 , down $ 1.875 , a 26 % decline . A spokesman said the savings bank may not <span style='background:silver'>qualify</span> for the capital requirements because , under the proposed guidelines , its $ 380 million of preferred stock does n't <span style='background:silver'>meet</span> the " core capital " criteria outlined under the new Financial Institutions Reform , Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 . He added that final guidelines to be published in early November will determine whether the bank is in compliance .

Additionally , Crossland reported a third-quarter loss of $ 175.5 million , or $ 13.44 a share , compared with net income of $ 27.1 million , or $ 1.16 a share , a year ago . A major factor in the third-quarter loss was the write-down of $ 143.6 million of goodwill . The spokesman said that the proposed <span style='background:lightblue'>guidelines</span> caused Crossland to <span style='background:cyan'><span style='background:lightblue'>revise</span></span> its business objectives and , consequently , to <span style='background:cyan'>write</span> down the asset value of some previous acquisitions . Crossland recorded an additional $ 20 million in loan loss reserves in the third quarter . Net interest income for the third quarter declined to $ 35.6 million from $ 70.1 million a year ago .

About $ 518 million of debt is affected .</p><h3>Causal Relations                 with events defined as verb or nouns (Mirza's work):</h3><table border="1" class="dataframe">
