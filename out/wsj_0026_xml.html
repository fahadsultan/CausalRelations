The action <span style='background:yellow'>came</span> in response to a <span style='background:yellow'>petition</span> filed by Timex Inc. for changes in the U.S. Generalized System of Preferences for imports from developing nations . Previously , watch imports were denied such duty-free treatment . Timex had requested duty-free treatment for many types of watches , covered by 58 different U.S. tariff classifications . The White House said Mr. Bush decided to grant duty-free status for 18 categories , but <span style='background:silver'>turned</span> down such treatment for other types of watches " because of the <span style='background:silver'>potential</span> for material injury to watch producers located in the U.S. and the Virgin Islands . " Timex is a major U.S. producer and seller of watches , including low-priced battery-operated watches assembled in the Philippines and other developing nations covered by the U.S. tariff preferences . U.S. trade officials said the Philippines and Thailand would be the main beneficiaries of the president 's action . Imports of the types of watches that now will be eligible for duty-free treatment totaled about $ 37.3 million in 1988 , a relatively small share of the $ 1.5 billion in U.S. watch imports that year , according to an aide to U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills .</p><h3>Causal Relations                 with events defined as verb or nouns (Mirza's work):</h3><table border="1" class="dataframe">
