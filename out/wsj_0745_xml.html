GM sought U.S. antitrust clearance last week to purchase more than $ 15 million worth of Jaguar shares but does n't own any yet , according to GM officials here and at the company 's Detroit headquarters . The No. 1 U.S. auto maker then wrote Jaguar that it intends " to go to that 15 % " level once it wins the U.S. clearance to go beyond $ 15 million , a Jaguar spokesman said yesterday . The GM <span style='background:yellow'>move</span> follows Tuesday 's <span style='background:yellow'>declaration</span> by Ford , which holds an unwelcome 12.45 % stake in Jaguar , that it is prepared to bid for the entire company . GM is close to completing a friendly deal with Jaguar that is likely to involve an eventual 30 % stake and joint manufacturing ventures . Speculative investors , betting on an imminent clash between Ford and GM , pushed up Jaguar 's share price five pence ( eight U.S. cents ) to a near-record 720 pence ( $ 11.60 ) in late trading on London 's stock exchange yesterday . Since Tuesday , the shares have gained nearly 4 % . But an all-out bidding war between the world 's top auto giants for Britain 's leading luxury-car maker seems unlikely . " We will not go over a certain level , " said David N. McCammon , Ford 's vice president for finance , at a news conference yesterday in Dearborn , Mich . " There 's some price at which we 'd stop bidding . " He would n't specify what it was . And powerful political <span style='background:silver'>pressures</span> may convince the Conservative government to <span style='background:silver'>keep</span> its so-called golden share , which limits any individual holding to 15 % , until the restriction expires on Dec . 31 , 1990 . " I really do n't see the government doing something that Jaguar does n't want over the next 14 months , " said Kenneth Warren , a Conservative member of Parliament and chairman of the Select Committee on Trade and Industry in Britain 's House of Commons . " The golden share is a single share , but it is the magic share . " The government retained the single share after selling its stake in Jaguar in 1984 -- part of a nationalistic practice of protecting former government-owned enterprises to deflect criticism of privatization . The 15 % restriction covers any would-be suitor , British or foreign . Ford is willing to bid for 100 % of Jaguar 's shares if both the government and Jaguar shareholders agree to relax the anti-takeover barrier prematurely . As Jaguar 's biggest holder and Britain 's biggest car maker , Ford could turn up the heat by convening a special shareholders ' meeting and urging holders to drop the limits early . Ford might <span style='background:lightblue'>succeed</span> because many shareholders <span style='background:lightblue'>are</span> speculators keen for a full bid or institutional investors unhappy over Jaguar management 's handling of its current financial difficulties . The government probably would n't give in readily to a hostile foray by Ford , however . It has relinquished a golden share only once before -- during British Petroleum Co.'s # 2.5 billion ( $ 4 billion ) takeover of Britoil PLC in 1988 . In wooing British lawmakers , GM has pointed out that its <span style='background:gray'><span style='background:cyan'>willingness</span></span> to settle for a minority stake would keep Jaguar <span style='background:cyan'>British-owned</span> and <span style='background:gray'>independent</span> . This week , the U.S. auto giant paid for 10 House of Commons members and two House of Lords members to fly to Detroit and tour its operations there . While the visit was unrelated to Jaguar , GM Chairman Roger Smith answered the legislators ' questions about it over lunch Tuesday . He said Jaguar " should n't be smothered by anyone else , " recalled one participant . Politics also influences the government 's thinking on the anti-takeover restriction . The Conservatives do n't dare jeopardize marginal Tory seats in Coventry , where Jaguar has headquarters , nor can the government easily back down on promised protection for a privatized company while it proceeds with controversial plans to privatize most of Britain 's water and electricity industries . Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher might , however , be receptive to any request by Jaguar Chairman Sir John Egan for the restriction 's early <span style='background:red'><span style='background:orange'>removal</span></span> to let GM <span style='background:orange'>amass</span> more than 15 % or <span style='background:red'>mount</span> a friendly suitor bid against Ford . In the end , Sir John -- rather than the government or Jaguar shareholders -- may hold the key that unlocks the golden share .</p><h3>Causal Relations                 with events defined as verb or nouns (Mirza's work):</h3><table border="1" class="dataframe">
