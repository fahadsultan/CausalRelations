The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 39.55 points , to 2613.73 , in active trading . Long-term Treasury bonds ended slightly higher . The dollar rose modestly against the mark and the yen , but soared against the pound following the resignation of Britain 's chancellor of the Exchequer , Nigel Lawson . Analysts have complained that third-quarter corporate earnings have n't been very good , but the effect hit home particularly hard yesterday . Compaq Computer nose-dived $ 8.625 a share , to $ 100 , and pulled other technology issues lower after reporting lower-than-expected earnings after the stock market closed Wednesday . Later yesterday the nation 's major auto makers added to the gloom when they each reported their core auto operations were net losers in the third quarter . The less-than-robust third-quarter results came amid renewed concern about the volatility of stock prices and the role of computer-aided program trading . Taken together , the worries prompted a broad sell-off of stocks . The number of stocks on the New York Stock Exchange that fell in price yesterday exceeded 1,000 , a key measure of underlying sentiment among technical analysts . Although the government said the economy grew an estimated 2.5 % in the third quarter , in line with expectations , analysts are increasingly <span style='background:yellow'>predicting</span> much more sluggish growth -- and therefore more corporate earnings <span style='background:yellow'>disappointments</span> -- for the fourth quarter . " There are a lot more downward revisions of earnings forecasts than upward revisions , " said Abby Joseph Cohen , a market strategist at Drexel Burnham Lambert . " People are questioning corporate profits as a pillar of support for the equity market . " The bond market was unmoved by the economic statistics . While bond investors would have preferred growth to be a little slower , they were cheered by inflation measures in the data that showed prices rising at a modest annual rate of 2.9 % . That is another small encouragement for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates in coming weeks , they reasoned . In major market activity : Stock prices fell sharply in active trading . Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 175.2 million shares . Declining issues on the Big Board outstripped gainers 1,141 to 406 . Bond prices were barely higher .
