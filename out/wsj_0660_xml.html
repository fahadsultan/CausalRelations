Montedison now owns about 72 % of Erbamont 's shares outstanding . The companies said the accord was unanimously approved by a special committee of Erbamont directors unaffiliated with Montedison . Under the pact , Montedision will make a $ 37-a-share tender offer for Erbamont stock outstanding . The tender offer will be followed by the sale of all of Erbamont 's assets , subject to all of its liabilities , to Montedison . Erbamont will then be liquidated , with any remaining Erbamont holders receiving a distribution of $ 37 a share . The companies said the transaction is being <span style='background:yellow'>structured</span> this way because the laws of the Netherlands Antilles , under which Erbamont is organized , do n't <span style='background:yellow'>provide</span> for merger transactions .</p><h3>Causal Relations                 with events defined as verb or nouns (Mirza's work):</h3><table border="1" class="dataframe">
