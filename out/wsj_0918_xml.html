<style>                    table, td, th {                        border: 1px solid white;                }</style><p>Du Pont Co. reported that third-quarter profit grew a robust 19 % from a year ago on the strength of the company 's operations in various chemicals and fibers , and in petroleum . Du Pont also raised its quarterly dividend to $ 1.20 a share from $ 1.05 , a change that will increase the annualized payout to shareholders by some $ 140 million . Du Pont , unlike companies <span style='background:yellow'>hurt</span> badly by sharp price <span style='background:yellow'>declines</span> for basic chemicals and plastics , is benefiting from its broad range of businesses . The profit gain was made despite a weakening in the housing market , for which the company is a supplier , and a strengthening in the dollar , which lowers the value of overseas earnings when they are translated into dollars . The Wilmington , Del . , company reported net of $ 547 million , or $ 2.36 a share , which was in line with Wall Street estimates . In the year-earlier period , the company earned $ 461 million , or $ 1.91 a share . Sales in the latest quarter were $ 8.59 billion , up 9.4 % from $ 7.85 billion . The dividend increase was Du Pont 's second this year , an affirmation of statements by top executives that they intend to increase rewards to shareholders . " We have n't benefited the shareholder as much as we need to , " said Edgar Woolard Jr., Du Pont 's chairman and chief executive officer , in an interview several months before he entered his current position in April . The largest beneficiary will be Seagram Co., which owns about 23 % of Du Pont . A spokesman for Seagram , the Montreal wine and spirits concern controlled by the Bronfman family , said the company will post additional pretax profit of about $ 33 million a year because of the additional Du Pont dividends . Du Pont also announced plans for a 3-for-1 stock split , although the initial higher dividend will be paid on pre-split shares . Du Pont 's stock rose $ 2.50 a share to close at $ 117.375 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday . Seagram closed at $ 84.75 , up 12.5 cents a share in Big Board trading . Leading the gains for Du Pont in the latest quarter was its industrial products segment , where profit soared to $ 155 million from $ 99 million a year earlier . The company benefited from continued strong demand and higher selling prices for titanium dioxide , a white pigment used in paints , paper and plastics . James Fallon , a New Providence , N.J., marketing consultant to the chemicals industry , says Du Pont still <span style='background:silver'>holds</span> an edge in making the pigment because the company <span style='background:silver'>was</span> " first in with the technology " to lower costs . He said Du Pont holds about 23 % of the world-wide market , the largest single share , at a time when growing uses for the pigment have kept it in tight supply , although others are now adding low-cost production capacity . Profit <span style='background:lightblue'>climbed</span> to $ 98 million from $ 71 million in the petroleum segment , as Du Pont 's Conoco Inc. oil company was <span style='background:lightblue'>helped</span> by crude oil prices higher than a year ago and by higher natural gas prices and volume . In the diversifed businesses segment , which includes herbicides , profit grew to $ 64 million from $ 27 million . A spokesman said herbicide use in some areas of the U.S. was <span style='background:gray'><span style='background:cyan'>delayed</span></span> earlier in the year by heavy <span style='background:gray'>rains</span> , thus <span style='background:cyan'>increasing</span> sales in the third quarter . In the fibers segment , profit rose to $ 180 million from $ 155 million , a gain Du Pont attributed to higher demand in the U.S. for most textile products . Two segments posted lower earnings for the quarter . Profit from coal <span style='background:orange'>fell</span> to $ 41 million from $ 58 million , partly because of a miners ' <span style='background:orange'>strike</span> . And profit from polymers dropped to $ 107 million from $ 122 million amid what Du Pont called lower demand and selling prices in certain packaging and industrial markets . For the nine months , Du Pont earned $ 2 billion , or $ 8.46 a share , up 18 % from $ 1.69 billion , or $ 7.03 a share , a year earlier . Sales increased 10 % to $ 26.54 billion from $ 24.05 billion . The increased dividend will be paid Dec . 14 to holders of record Nov . 15 . The stock split , which is subject to holder approval , would be paid on a still unspecified date in January to holders of record Dec . 21 .</p><h3>Causal Relations                 with events defined as verb or nouns (Mirza's work):</h3><table border="1" class="dataframe">
