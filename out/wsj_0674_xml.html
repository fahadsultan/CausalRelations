Jim Pattison Industries , a holding company with annual sales of about C $ 1.9 billion , largely from car dealerships and grocery stores , did n't elaborate on the statement , and a company official declined further comment . The company said it currently holds about 4.2 million of Innopac 's 13.8 million common shares outstanding , which have an aggregate market value of about 137.8 million Canadian dollars ( US $ 117.3 million ) . Separately , Innopac reported a fourth-quarter <span style='background:yellow'>loss</span> of about C $ 2.6 million , or 18 Canadian cents a share , reflecting inventory <span style='background:yellow'>write-downs</span> . The results made net income for the year ended Aug . 31 C $ 2.7 million , or 20 Canadian cents a share , down from C $ 9.7 million , or 70 Canadian cents a share last year . Revenue was C $ 291.6 million , up from C $ 252 million in 1988 . Martin Fabi , Innopac 's president and chief executive , said Innopac viewed Mr. Pattison 's decision to seek control as a " very positive " move . " I 'm happy that he feels positively about our company , " he said . Mr. Fabi would n't say directly whether Mr. Pattison has disclosed potential terms for his planned bid for control . Among other things , Innopac is involved in recycling polystyrene foam products that are often used by fast food chains , such as McDonald 's Corp., for food packaging . A joint venture involving units of Innopac and Mobil Corp. earlier this year opened the first U.S. polystyrene recycling plant , in Leominster , Mass .</p><h3>Causal Relations                 with events defined as verb or nouns (Mirza's work):</h3><table border="1" class="dataframe">
