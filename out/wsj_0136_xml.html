The truck maker said the significant <span style='background:yellow'>drop</span> in net income will result in lower <span style='background:yellow'>earnings</span> for the fiscal year . In fiscal 1988 , the company earned $ 17.3 million , or $ 1.92 a share , on revenue of $ 352.9 million . Oshkosh Truck attributed the downturn in its earnings to higher start-up costs of its new chassis division , a softer motor-home market and higher administrative costs of compliance with government contractor regulations . The company said it is in the process of phasing out John Deere , its current source of production for midsized motor home chassis . In anticipation of the start-up of its new factory , the company said a larger-than-normal chassis supply has been built to carry it through the transition period .</p><h3>Causal Relations                 with events defined as verb or nouns (Mirza's work):</h3><table border="1" class="dataframe">
