" Mr. Reupke , 52 years old and a 27-year Reuters veteran , had been the information-services company 's general manager for only six months . His <span style='background:yellow'>appointment</span> to that post , which has senior administrative , staff and policy responsibilities , followed a several-year <span style='background:yellow'>tenure</span> as Reuters 's editor in chief . No successor was named , and Mr. Reupke 's duties will be split among three other senior Reuters executives , the company said . In a telephone interview , Mr. Reupke said his <span style='background:silver'>departure</span> was for " personal <span style='background:silver'>reasons</span> , " which he declined to specify . " There is no business reason for my departure , " nor any disagreement over policy , he added . He also rejected reports that his <span style='background:lightblue'>departure</span> stemmed from <span style='background:lightblue'>disappointment</span> the general manager 's post had n't also led to a board directorship at the London-based news organization . Mr. Reupke was one of three executives on Reuters 's eight-person executive committee who did n't also serve on the company 's board of directors . " If I were choosing the people of tomorrow , I would have chosen the people who are now on the board , " he said . A Reuters spokesman said the <span style='background:cyan'>departure</span> reflects " no <span style='background:cyan'>change</span> in strategy or profits . " Mark Shepperd , an analyst at UBS Phillips amp Drew in London , said , " I suspect ( the departure ) will be fairly irrelevant for the company . I would be very surprised if his <span style='background:orange'><span style='background:gray'>departure</span></span> signals any <span style='background:gray'>change</span> in strategy or <span style='background:orange'>change</span> in profit expectations . " On London 's Stock Exchange , Reuters shares rose five pence to 913 pence ( $ 14.43 ) . In the U.S. over-the-counter market , American depositary shares for Reuters , each representing three shares in the London market , closed unchanged at $ 43.875 . The senior of the three executives who will assume Mr. Reupke 's duties is Nigel Judah , 58 , finance director and a Reuters board director . Peter Holland , 45 , deputy general manager , becomes director of corporate affairs . And Patrick Mannix , 46 , international technical manager , becomes director of group quality programs .</p><h3>Causal Relations                 with events defined as verb or nouns (Mirza's work):</h3><table border="1" class="dataframe">
