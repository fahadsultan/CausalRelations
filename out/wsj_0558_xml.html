Catastrophe losses reduced Aetna 's net income by $ 50 million , including $ 36 million from Hugo . Last year catastrophe losses totaled $ 5 million , when net was $ 235.5 million , or $ 2.07 a share . The year-earlier results have been <span style='background:lightblue'>restated</span> to reflect an accounting <span style='background:lightblue'>change</span> . The insurer has started processing claims from the Northern California earthquake nearly two weeks ago . But because these claims are more <span style='background:cyan'>difficult</span> to evaluate and have been <span style='background:gray'>coming</span> in more slowly , the company <span style='background:gray'><span style='background:cyan'>has</span></span> no estimate of the impact of the earthquake on fourth-quarter results . In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday , Aetna closed at $ 60 , down 50 cents . In the latest quarter , Aetna had a $ 23 million loss on its auto / homeowners line , compared with earnings of $ 33 million last year . Profit for its commercial insurance division <span style='background:red'><span style='background:orange'>fell</span></span> 30 % to $ 59 million , reflecting higher catastrophe <span style='background:orange'>losses</span> and the price <span style='background:red'>war</span> in the property / casualty market for nearly three years . However , Aetna 's employee benefits division , which includes its group health insurance operations , posted a 34 % profit gain to $ 106 million . Third-quarter results included net realized capital gains of $ 48 million , which included $ 27 million from the sale of Federated Investors in August and a $ 15 million tax credit . In the nine months , net rose 4.3 % to $ 525.8 million or $ 4.67 a share , from $ 504.2 million , or $ 4.41 a share , last year .</p><h3>Causal Relations                 with events defined as verb or nouns (Mirza's work):</h3><table border="1" class="dataframe">
