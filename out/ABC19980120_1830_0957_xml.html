<html><body><p>For his part , Fidel Castro is the ultimate political survivor . People have predicted his demise so many times , and the US has tried to hasten it on several occasions . Time and again , he endures . He has outlasted and sometimes outsmarted eight American presidents . Fidel Castro <span style='background:yellow'>invited</span> John Paul to come for a reason . This <span style='background:yellow'>is</span> clearly an opportunity for Cuba to look good internationally . The entire world will see images of the Pope in Cuba . They 'll see images of the Pope with Fidel Castro . It will give the rest of the world the view that Cuba is like any other nation , something the US has , of course , tried to persuade the world that it is not . For nearly forty years , the United States has said categorically it would not tolerate totalitarian rule in its own backyard . It is the US economic and political embargo which has kept Cuba in a box . The main positive for Castro to invite the Pope is international , to be able to say to the rest of the world , this government is not as closed , as intolerant , uh as totalitarian as some make it out to be . One of the scenarios widely advanced before the visit is that through the Pope , Cuba , still led by Castro , can begin a more productive <span style='background:silver'>relationship</span> with the world . That will , in turn , bring pressure on Washington to <span style='background:silver'>change</span> . Those observers looking for a battle between uncompromising representatives and very different ideologies will , in all likelihood , be disappointed . Castro has said that you can be a Communist and still be a Christian . He says he and the Pope both want to end the exploitation of man by man . The question is who will Cubans believe ? The main negative is the risk that the Pope 's <span style='background:lightblue'>visit</span> will persuade a great many more Cubans to <span style='background:lightblue'>break</span> loose of the Cuban government . If so , then the Pope 's <span style='background:cyan'>visit</span> would really open up a new <span style='background:cyan'>chapter</span> in the government 's relations with its own society . For the Cuban government , that is the risk . At the end of the broadcast this evening , one more trip around Havana to see what it 's been like since the last time . And in just a moment Diane Sawyer will have some other news .</p></body></html><h3>Incoming edges (causes in this document found as effects in older documents)</h3>None found<h3>Outgoing edges (effects in this document found as causes in more recent documents)</h3>None found<h3>Incoming edges (causes in this document found as effects in older documents)</h3>None found<h3>Outgoing edges (effects in this document found as causes in more recent documents)</h3>None found<h3>Incoming edges (causes in this document found as effects in older documents)</h3>None found<h3>Outgoing edges (effects in this document found as causes in more recent documents)</h3>None found<h3>Incoming edges (causes in this document found as effects in older documents)</h3>None found<h3>Outgoing edges (effects in this document found as causes in more recent documents)</h3>None found<h3>Incoming edges (causes in this document found as effects in older documents)</h3>None found<h3>Outgoing edges (effects in this document found as causes in more recent documents)</h3>None found<h3>Incoming edges (causes in this document found as effects in older documents)</h3>None found<h3>Outgoing edges (effects in this document found as causes in more recent documents)</h3>None found<h3>Incoming edges (causes in this document found as effects in older documents)</h3>None found<h3>Outgoing edges (effects in this document found as causes in more recent documents)</h3>None found<h3>Incoming edges (causes in this document found as effects in older documents)</h3>None found<h3>Outgoing edges (effects in this document found as causes in more recent documents)</h3>None found<h3>Incoming edges (causes in this document found as effects in older documents)</h3>None found<h3>Outgoing edges (effects in this document found as causes in more recent documents)</h3>None found<h3>Incoming edges (causes in this document found as effects in older documents)</h3>None found<h3>Outgoing edges (effects in this document found as causes in more recent documents)</h3>None found<h3>Incoming edges (causes in this document found as effects in older documents)</h3>None found<h3>Outgoing edges (effects in this document found as causes in more recent documents)</h3>None found<h3>Incoming edges (causes in this document found as effects in older documents)</h3>None found<h3>Outgoing edges (effects in this document found as causes in more recent documents)</h3>None found<h3>Incoming edges (causes in this document found as effects in older documents)</h3>None found<h3>Outgoing edges (effects in this document found as causes in more recent documents)</h3>None found<h3>Incoming edges (causes in this document found as effects in older documents)</h3>None found<h3>Outgoing edges (effects in this document found as causes in more recent documents)</h3>None found<h3>Incoming edges (causes in this document found as effects in older documents)</h3>None found<h3>Outgoing edges (effects in this document found as causes in more recent documents)</h3>None found<h3>Incoming edges (causes in this document found as effects in older documents)</h3>None found<h3>Outgoing edges (effects in this document found as causes in more recent documents)</h3>None found<h3>Incoming edges (causes in this document found as effects in older documents)</h3>None found<h3>Outgoing edges (effects in this document found as causes in more recent documents)</h3>None found<h3>Incoming edges (causes in this document found as effects in older documents)</h3>None found<h3>Outgoing edges (effects in this document found as causes in more recent documents)</h3>None found<h3>Incoming edges (causes in this document found as effects in older documents)</h3>None found<h3>Outgoing edges (effects in this document found as causes in more recent documents)</h3>None found
