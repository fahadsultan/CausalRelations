Separately , two more of the nation 's top steelmakers -- Armco Inc. and National Intergroup Inc. -- reported lower operating earnings in their steel businesses , marking what is generally believed to be the end of a two-year boom in the industry . Wall Street analysts expect the disappointing trend to continue into the fourth quarter and through at least the first two quarters of 1990 , when the industry will increasingly see the effect of price erosion in major product lines , such as rolled sheet used for cars , appliances and construction . " It does n't bode well for coming quarters , " said John Jacobson , who follows the steel industry for AUS Consultants . In fact , he thinks several steelmakers will report actual losses through the third quarter of 1990 . Bethlehem , the nation 's second largest steelmaker , earned $ 46.9 million , or 54 cents a share . The figures include $ 15 million in costs related to a blast furnace outage and $ 8 million in losses from unauthorized work outages at the company 's coal operations . In the year-ago period , Bethlehem earned $ 101.4 million , or $ 1.27 a share , including a $ 3.8 million gain from early retirement of debt . Third-quarter sales dropped 11 % to $ 1.27 billion from $ 1.43 billion a year ago . In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange , Bethlehem shares rose 50 cents to $ 17.375 . Of all the major steelmakers , Bethlehem would seem to be the most vulnerable to a slowdown . It has n't diversified beyond steel , nor has it linked up with a joint venture partner to share costs and risks . However , in spite of the difficult industrywide environment of high cost and low volume , Bethlehem " had pretty good earnings numbers , " said Michelle Galanter Applebaum , an analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc. Ms. Applebaum had estimated third-quarter earnings of 55 cents a shhha55 cents a share , ents a share , but ssa share , but said the losses for the unusual items were larger than expected . Still , Bethlehem 's core basic steel operations experienced a steep drop in operating profit to $ 58.6 million from $ 186.4 million a year ago , when the industry enjoyed strong demand and pricing . The company said its shipments <span style='background:silver'><span style='background:yellow'>declined</span></span> as a result of a <span style='background:yellow'>reduction</span> in inventories by service centers , a lackluster automotive market and <span style='background:silver'>increasing</span> competitive pressures in the construction market . At the same time , production costs , compared with a year ago , were <span style='background:lightblue'>boosted</span> by higher raw material and employment costs , which resulted from the company 's new labor <span style='background:lightblue'>pact</span> effective June 1 . " We anticipate that steel market conditions will <span style='background:gray'><span style='background:cyan'>exhibit</span></span> a further moderate decline in the fourth quarter as the automotive sector <span style='background:cyan'>remains</span> weak and customers <span style='background:gray'>continue</span> to adjust inventories , " said Bethlehem Chairman Walter F. Williams . He noted , however , that the company 's order entry has increased from the low levels of the early summer , following the end of labor negotiations . Steel business , said third-quarter net income dropped 8 % to $ 33 million , or 35 cents a share , from $ 36 million , or 39 cents a share in the year-ago quarter . Sales <span style='background:orange'>dropped</span> to $ 441.1 million from $ 820.4 million , because the company no longer <span style='background:orange'>consolidates</span> its Eastern Steel division , which is now a joint venture with Kawasaki Steel Corp. Along with reduced volume , analysts said the nation 's fifth largest steelmaker was <span style='background:red'>hurt</span> by <span style='background:red'>holding</span> higher-cost inventory when raw material costs of such key products as nickel dropped . Operating profit dropped 46 % in its specialty flat-rolled steel segment . Moreover , the company said higher sales and shipments to service centers from its Armco Steel Co. joint venture failed to offset weakness in the automotive market , higher production costs and a poorer product mix . Armco shares closed unchanged at $ 10.625 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange . National Intergroup , which owns 50 % of the nation 's sixth largest steelmaker -- National Steel Corp. -- posted net income for the fiscal second-quarter of $ 8.6 million , or 33 cents a share , compared with a net loss of $ 50.3 million . Sales increased in the quarter ended Sept . 30 to $ 747.8 million from $ 623.5 million a year ago . The latest period includes gains of $ 9.1 million from early retirement of debt and tax loss carry-forward . Last year 's results were hurt by $ 41.3 million in restructuring charges . National Intergroup stock closed at $ 15 , unchanged in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange . The company noted that its Fox - Meyer Drug Co., Ben Franklin Stores Inc. and Permian Corp. operations <span style='background:green'>showed</span> improvements as a result of restructuring <span style='background:green'>moves</span> . However , its equity in the net income of National Steel <span style='background:brown'><span style='background:pink'>declined</span></span> to $ 6.3 million from $ 10.9 million as a result of softer <span style='background:pink'>demand</span> and lost <span style='background:brown'>orders</span> following prolonged labor talks and a threatened strike . National Intergroup is negotiating for the sale of its 50 % interest in National Steel to concentrate more fully on drug distribution operations .</p><h3>Causal Relations                 with events defined as verb or nouns (Mirza's work):</h3><table border="1" class="dataframe">
