DSM said net income in the third quarter jumped 63 % as the company had substantially lower extraordinary charges to account for a restructuring program . The Dutch chemical group said net income gained to 235 million guilders ( $ 113.2 million ) , or 6.70 guilders a share , from 144 million guilders , or 4.10 guilders a share , a year ago . The 32 % state-owned DSM had eight million guilders of extraordinary charges in the latest quarter , mainly to reflect one-time <span style='background:yellow'>losses</span> in connection with the <span style='background:yellow'>disposal</span> of some operations . The charges were <span style='background:silver'>offset</span> in part by a <span style='background:lightblue'><span style='background:silver'>gain</span></span> from the <span style='background:lightblue'>sale</span> of the company 's construction division . Last year , DSM had 71 million guilders of extraordinary charges for the restructuring program and other transactions . The earnings <span style='background:cyan'>growth</span> also was fueled by the company 's ability to <span style='background:cyan'>cut</span> net financing spending by half to around 15 million guilders . Also , substantially lower Dutch corporate tax rates helped the company keep its tax outlay flat relative to earnings growth , the company added . Sales , however , were little changed at 2.46 billion guilders , compared with 2.42 billion guilders .</p><h3>Causal Relations                 with events defined as verb or nouns (Mirza's work):</h3><table border="1" class="dataframe">
