The St. Louis company earned $ 45.2 million , or 65 cents a share , compared with $ 84.9 million , or $ 1.24 a share , a year earlier . Sales in the latest period were $ 1.76 billion , a 13 % increase from last year 's $ 1.55 billion . For the year ended Sept . 30 , Ralston earned $ 422.5 million , or $ 6.44 a share , up 8.9 % from $ 387.8 million , or $ 5.63 a share . This year 's results included a gain of $ 70.2 million on the disposal of seafood operations . Sales for the full year were $ 6.6 billion , up 13 % from $ 5.8 billion . Ralston said its restructuring costs include the phase-out of a battery facility in Greenville , N.C., the recent closing of a Hostess cake bakery in Cincinnati and a reduction in staff throughout the company . The battery plant , which makes rechargeable nickel cadmium and carbon zinc products , will be closed over the next year or so , a spokesman said . Ralston attributed its fourth-quarter slump partly to higher costs of ingredients in the pet food business as well as competitive pressures , which required higher advertising spending . For the year , pet food volume was flat , the company said . Its cereal division realized higher operating profit on volume increases , but also spent more on promotion . The Continental Baking business benefited from higher margins on bread and on increased cake sales , it added . Ralston said its Eveready battery unit was <span style='background:lightblue'>hurt</span> by continuing economic <span style='background:lightblue'>problems</span> in South America . Ralston shares closed yesterday at $ 80.50 , off $ 1 , in New York Stock Exchange composite trading .</p><h3>Causal Relations                 with events defined as verb or nouns (Mirza's work):</h3><table border="1" class="dataframe">
