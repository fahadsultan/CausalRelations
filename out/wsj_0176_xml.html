A spokeswoman for Crum amp Forster said employees were told early this week that numerous staff functions for the personal insurance lines were going to be centralized as a cost-cutting move . She said the <span style='background:yellow'>move</span> would result in a after-tax <span style='background:yellow'>charge</span> of less than $ 4 million to be spread over the next three quarters . By comparison , for the first nine months , Xerox earned $ 492 million , or $ 4.55 a share , on revenue of $ 12.97 billion . Earnings at Xerox 's financial-services operations actually <span style='background:silver'>rose</span> slightly , but that was largely because capital gains at Crum amp Forster <span style='background:silver'>offset</span> Hurricane Hugo payments and the reserves set up to cover future payments . Property / casualty insurance has been a tough business in recent quarters , as pricing has been cutthroat and natural disasters such as <span style='background:lightblue'>Hurricane</span> Hugo and the California <span style='background:cyan'>earthquake</span> have resulted in huge <span style='background:cyan'><span style='background:lightblue'>payments</span></span> .</p><h3>Causal Relations                 with events defined as verb or nouns (Mirza's work):</h3><table border="1" class="dataframe">
