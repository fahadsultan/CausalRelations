<html><body><p>Officials in California are warning residents that oncoming <span style='background:yellow'>rains</span> will cause dangerous and unpredictable <span style='background:yellow'>landslides</span> . From member station KQED , Auncil Martinez reports . Experts say the ground is so saturated it can not absorb any more water . So that means soil will fall off in chunks and destroy anything in its path . In Los Angeles that lesson was brought home today when tons of earth cascaded down a hillside , ripping two houses from their foundations . No one was hurt , but firefighters ordered the evacuation of nearby homes and said they 'll monitor the shifting ground . In the northern California town of Rio Nido , officials say a football field sized slab of hillside could still break loose at any time and destroy an entire neighborhood . And in San Francisco , a mansion overlooking the Pacific Ocean and the Golden Gate Bridge is slipping toward the sea . Forecasters say the picture will <span style='background:silver'>get</span> worse because more <span style='background:silver'>rains</span> are on the way . For NPR news , I 'm Auncil Martinez reporting .</p></body></html><h3>Incoming edges (causes in this document found as effects in older documents)</h3>None found<h3>Outgoing edges (effects in this document found as causes in more recent documents)</h3>None found<h3>Incoming edges (causes in this document found as effects in older documents)</h3>None found<h3>Outgoing edges (effects in this document found as causes in more recent documents)</h3>None found<h3>Incoming edges (causes in this document found as effects in older documents)</h3>None found<h3>Outgoing edges (effects in this document found as causes in more recent documents)</h3>None found<h3>Incoming edges (causes in this document found as effects in older documents)</h3>None found<h3>Outgoing edges (effects in this document found as causes in more recent documents)</h3>None found<h3>Incoming edges (causes in this document found as effects in older documents)</h3>None found<h3>Outgoing edges (effects in this document found as causes in more recent documents)</h3>None found<h3>Incoming edges (causes in this document found as effects in older documents)</h3>None found<h3>Outgoing edges (effects in this document found as causes in more recent documents)</h3>None found<h3>Incoming edges (causes in this document found as effects in older documents)</h3>None found<h3>Outgoing edges (effects in this document found as causes in more recent documents)</h3>None found<h3>Incoming edges (causes in this document found as effects in older documents)</h3>None found<h3>Outgoing edges (effects in this document found as causes in more recent documents)</h3>None found<h3>Incoming edges (causes in this document found as effects in older documents)</h3>None found<h3>Outgoing edges (effects in this document found as causes in more recent documents)</h3>None found<h3>Incoming edges (causes in this document found as effects in older documents)</h3>None found<h3>Outgoing edges (effects in this document found as causes in more recent documents)</h3>None found<h3>Incoming edges (causes in this document found as effects in older documents)</h3>None found<h3>Outgoing edges (effects in this document found as causes in more recent documents)</h3>None found<h3>Incoming edges (causes in this document found as effects in older documents)</h3>None found<h3>Outgoing edges (effects in this document found as causes in more recent documents)</h3>None found<h3>Incoming edges (causes in this document found as effects in older documents)</h3>None found<h3>Outgoing edges (effects in this document found as causes in more recent documents)</h3>None found<h3>Incoming edges (causes in this document found as effects in older documents)</h3>None found<h3>Outgoing edges (effects in this document found as causes in more recent documents)</h3>None found<h3>Incoming edges (causes in this document found as effects in older documents)</h3>None found<h3>Outgoing edges (effects in this document found as causes in more recent documents)</h3>None found<h3>Incoming edges (causes in this document found as effects in older documents)</h3>None found<h3>Outgoing edges (effects in this document found as causes in more recent documents)</h3>None found<h3>Incoming edges (causes in this document found as effects in older documents)</h3>None found<h3>Outgoing edges (effects in this document found as causes in more recent documents)</h3>None found<h3>Incoming edges (causes in this document found as effects in older documents)</h3>None found<h3>Outgoing edges (effects in this document found as causes in more recent documents)</h3>None found<h3>Incoming edges (causes in this document found as effects in older documents)</h3>None found<h3>Outgoing edges (effects in this document found as causes in more recent documents)</h3>None found
