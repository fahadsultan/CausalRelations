<html><body><p>Finally today , we learned that the space agency has finally taken a giant leap forward . Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Eileen Collins will be named commander of the Space Shuttle Columbia for a mission in December . Colonel Collins has been the co-pilot before , but this time she 's the boss . Here 's ABC 's Ned Potter . Even two hundred miles up in space , there has been a glass ceiling . It was n't until twenty years after the first astronauts were chosen that NASA finally included six women , and they were all scientists , not pilots . No woman has actually been in charge of a mission until now . Just the fact that we 're <span style='background:yellow'>doing</span> the job that we 're doing makes us <span style='background:yellow'>role</span> models . That was Eileen Collins , after she flew as the first ever co-pilot . Being commander is different . It means supervising the rest of the crew in training and leading them in flight . It is , in short , the kind of management job many American women say they 've had to fight for . In space , some say female pilots were <span style='background:silver'>held</span> up until now by the <span style='background:silver'>lack</span> of piloting opportunities for them in the military . Once Colonel Collins was picked as a NASA astronaut , she followed a normal progression within NASA . Nobody hurried her up . No one held her back . Many NASA watchers say female astronauts have become part of the agency 's routine . But they still have catching up to do two hundred and thirty four Americans have flown in space , only twenty six of them women .
