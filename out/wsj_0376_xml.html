The British chemical and textile company 's plan , which requires shareholder approval , would create a new , listed U.K. stock with a probable market capitalization between # 300 million ( $ 473 million ) and # 400 million , analysts said . The establishment of the separate company , to be called Courtaulds Textiles , could be effective as early as next year 's first quarter . Investors welcomed the move . Courtaulds ' shares rose 15 pence to 362 pence , valuing the entire company at about # 1.44 billion . Courtaulds ' <span style='background:yellow'>spinoff</span> reflects <span style='background:yellow'>pressure</span> on British industry to boost share prices beyond the reach of corporate raiders . Courtaulds ' restructuring is among the largest thus far in Britain , though it is dwarfed by B.A.T Industries PLC 's plans to <span style='background:silver'>spin</span> roughly off # 4 billion in assets to help <span style='background:silver'>fend</span> off a takeover bid from Anglo - French financier Sir James Goldsmith . The divested Courtaulds textile operations had operating profit of # 50 million on # 980 million in revenue in the year ended March 31 . Some analysts have said Courtaulds ' moves could <span style='background:lightblue'>boost</span> the company 's value by 5 % to 10 % , because the two entities separately will <span style='background:lightblue'>carry</span> a higher price earnings multiple than they did combined . In addition , Courtaulds said the moves are <span style='background:cyan'>logical</span> because they will <span style='background:cyan'>allow</span> both the chemicals and textile businesses to focus more closely on core activities . Courtaulds has been under pressure to <span style='background:gray'>enhance</span> shareholder value since takeover speculators -- including Australian financier Kerry Packer -- <span style='background:gray'>surfaced</span> holding small stakes last year . Though Mr. Packer has since sold his stake , Courtaulds is moving to keep its institutional shareholders happy . Even without a specific takeover threat , Courtaulds is giving shareholders " choice and value , " said Julia Blake , an analyst at London stockbrokers Barclays de Zoete Wedd . In a statement , the company said : " Both parts can only realize their full potential and be appropriately valued by the market if they are separately quoted companies . The sharper definition and the autonomy which each will thereby gain will benefit shareholders , customers and employees . " Courtaulds Chairman and Chief Executive Sir Christopher Hogg will remain in both posts at the surviving chemical company after the spinoff .</p><h3>Causal Relations                 with events defined as verb or nouns (Mirza's work):</h3><table border="1" class="dataframe">
