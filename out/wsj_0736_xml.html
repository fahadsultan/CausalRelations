Poughkeepsie also expects to <span style='background:yellow'>post</span> a one-time charge of $ 8.3 million , resulting in a net <span style='background:yellow'>loss</span> for the third quarter . The charge represents a write-down of the goodwill associated with Poughkeepsie 's investment in the banks it is trying to sell and its North Carolina branches as well . The thrift announced the plan Aug . 21 . Among other reasons , high fees regulators imposed on certain transfers of thrift deposits to commercial banks " substantially altered the economics of the transaction for both parties , " Poughkeepsie said . Additionally , the bank is increasing its loan-loss reserves for the third quarter by $ 8.5 million before taxes . In the year-earlier third quarter , Poughkeepsie Savings had net income of $ 2.8 million , or 77 cents a share . Poughkeepsie said it is continuing to try to sell itself , under a June agreement with a dissident-shareholder group . The bank also said its effort would <span style='background:silver'>continue</span> past the Nov . 1 deadline set in that agreement and that the litigation between the two sides might <span style='background:silver'>resume</span> as a result . The thrift and the holders had suspended their lawsuits as part of the agreement .</p><h3>Causal Relations                 with events defined as verb or nouns (Mirza's work):</h3><table border="1" class="dataframe">
