<style>                    table, td, th {                        border: 1px solid white;                }</style><p>RJR Nabisco Inc. said it agreed to sell its Baby Ruth , Butterfinger and Pearson candy businesses to Nestle S.A.'s Nestle Foods unit for $ 370 million . The <span style='background:silver'><span style='background:yellow'>sale</span></span> , at a higher price than some analysts had expected , helps the food and tobacco giant <span style='background:yellow'>raise</span> funds to pay debt and <span style='background:silver'>boosts</span> Nestle 's 7 % share of the U.S. candy market to about 12 % . The candy businesses had sales of about $ 154 million last year , which was roughly 12 % of total revenue for RJR 's Planters LifeSavers unit , according to a memorandum distributed by RJR 's owner , Kohlberg Kravis Roberts amp Co., to bankers last December . The Nestle acquisition includes a candy plant in Franklin Park , Ill . , which employs about 800 workers . The sale , which had been expected , is part of KKR 's program to pay down $ 5 billion of a $ 6 billion bridge loan by February . Roughly $ 2 billion of that debt has already been repaid from previous asset sales , and RJR expects to use another $ 2 billion from the pending , two-part sale of most of its Del Monte unit . That sale , however , could still <span style='background:lightblue'>fall</span> through if financing problems develop . Thus , it <span style='background:lightblue'>remains</span> crucial for RJR to obtain top dollar for its smaller assets like the candy brands . Louis Gerstner Jr., chairman and chief executive officer of New York-based RJR , called the sale a " significant step " in the company 's divestiture program , as well as a " a strategic divestiture . " Since KKR bought RJR in February for $ 25 billion of debt , it has agreed to sell nearly $ 5 billion of RJR assets . RJR 's executives have said they will dispense with certain brands , in particular , that are n't leaders in their markets . " RJR Nabisco and Planters LifeSavers will concentrate more on our own core businesses , " Mr. Gerstner said Friday . Baby Ruth and Butterfinger are both among the top-selling 15 chocolate bars in the U.S., but RJR 's overall share of the roughly $ 5.1 billion market is less than 5 % . Nestle 's share of 7 % before Friday 's purchases is far below the shares of market leaders Hershey Foods Corp. and Mars Inc., which have about 40 % and 36 % of the market , respectively . " This means Nestle is now in the candybar business in a big way , " said Lisbeth Echeandia , publisher of Orlando , Fla . -based Confectioner Magazine . " For them , it makes all kinds of sense . They 've been given a mandate from Switzerland " to expand their U.S. chocolate operations . Nestle S.A. is based in Vevey , Switzerland . The new candy bars , " make an important contribution to our Nestle Foods commitment to this very important strategic unit , " said C. Alan MacDonald , president of Nestle Foods in Purchase , N.Y.</p><h3>Causal Relations                 with events defined as verb or nouns (Mirza's work):</h3><table border="1" class="dataframe">
