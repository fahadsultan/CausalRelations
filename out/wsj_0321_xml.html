However , StatesWest is n't abandoning its pursuit of the much-larger Mesa . StatesWest , which has a 7.25 % stake in Mesa , said it may purchase more Mesa stock or make a tender offer directly to Mesa shareholders . StatesWest had proposed acquiring Mesa for $ 7 a share and one share of a new series of StatesWest 6 % convertible preferred stock it values at $ 3 a share . Earlier , Mesa had rejected a general proposal from StatesWest to combine the two carriers in some way . StatesWest serves 10 cities in California , Arizona and Nevada . Mesa flies to 42 cities in New Mexico , Arizona , Wyoming , Colorado and Texas .</p><h3>Causal Relations                 with events defined as verb or nouns (Mirza's work):</h3><table border="1" class="dataframe">
