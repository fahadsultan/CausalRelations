Institut Merieux S.A., which offered 942 million Canadian dollars ( US $ 801.2 million ) , or C $ 37 a share for Connaught , said it would extend its bid , due to expire last Thursday , to Nov . 6 . A C $ 30-a-share bid by Ciba - Geigy Ltd., a pharmaceutical company based in Basel , Switzerland , and California-based Chiron Corp., a bioresearch concern , was extended to Nov . 16 . It had been due to expire Friday evening . Merieux previously said it would ensure its bid remained open pending a final decision by Canadian regulators on whether to approve the takeover . Merieux , a vaccine and bioresearch firm based in Lyon , France , is controlled 50.1 % by state-owned Rhone Poulenc S.A. The Canadian government previously said Merieux 's bid did n't offer enough " net benefit " to Canada to be approved , and gave Merieux an until mid-November to submit additional information . Merieux officials said last week that they are " highly confident " the offer will be approved once it submits details of its proposed investments to federal regulators . Both offers are conditional on regulatory approvals and enough shares being tendered to give the bidders a majority of Connaught 's shares outstanding . Institut Merieux , which already holds a 12.5 % stake in Connaught , said that at the close of business Thursday , 5,745,188 shares of Connaught and C $ 44.3 million face amount of debentures , convertible into 1,826,596 common shares , had been tendered to its offer . At the close of business Thursday , Ciba - Geigy and Chiron said 11,580 common shares had been tendered to their offer . At last report , Connaught had 21.8 million shares outstanding . Separately , the Ontario Supreme Court said it will postpone indefinitely a ruling on the lawsuit launched by the University of Toronto against Connaught in connection with the Merieux bid . In a statement prepared by lawyers for the university and Connaught , the parties said they agreed that as a result of <span style='background:yellow'>reaching</span> a C415 million research accord , " It is <span style='background:yellow'>unnecessary</span> that there be a judgment on the merits { of the case } at this time . " Lawyers for the two sides were n't immediately available for comment . The university had sought an <span style='background:lightblue'><span style='background:silver'>injunction</span></span> blocking Connaught 's board from <span style='background:silver'>recommending</span> or <span style='background:lightblue'>supporting</span> an offer for the company by Merieux .</p><h3>Causal Relations                 with events defined as verb or nouns (Mirza's work):</h3><table border="1" class="dataframe">
