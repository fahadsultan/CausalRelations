London shares were <span style='background:silver'><span style='background:yellow'>depressed</span></span> initially by overnight <span style='background:yellow'>losses</span> in New York and by the <span style='background:silver'>drop</span> in sterling after Mr. Lawson 's resignation . It showed some early resilience after central bank support firmed sterling , but the weight of Wall Street late in London trading , and signs of further weakness in the British pound , proved a hefty load to bear . New York stocks recovered some of their losses after the London market closed . The Financial Times 100-share index shed 47.3 points to close at 2082.1 , down 4.5 % from the previous Friday and 6.8 % from Oct . 13 , when Wall Street 's <span style='background:lightblue'>plunge</span> helped <span style='background:lightblue'>spark</span> the current weakness in London . The 30-share index settled 42.0 points lower at 1678.5. Volume was 840.8 million shares , up from 443.6 million Thursday and the week 's most active session . Dealers said the <span style='background:cyan'>turnover</span> , largely confined to the 100-share index stocks , partly reflected the <span style='background:cyan'>flurry</span> of activity typical at the close of a two-week trading account and the start of a new account . But they said Friday 's focus on the top-tier stocks telegraphed active overseas <span style='background:orange'>selling</span> and <span style='background:gray'>showed</span> the broad-based fears over the status of the U.K. economy and Britain 's currency in the wake of the <span style='background:orange'><span style='background:gray'>upheaval</span></span> in Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher 's cabinet . A senior dealer with Warburg Securities noted British Gas , the most active blue-chip stock at 20 million shares traded , was affected by the political implications of Mr. Lawson 's departure and Mrs. Thatcher 's cabinet shuffle . He attributed the unusually high volume to broad-based selling on fears that the Thatcher government may be in turmoil and Britain 's Labor Party positioned to regain control of the government and renew efforts at nationalization . British Gas shed 8.5 pence a share to close at 185 pence ( $ 2.90 ) . Other dealers added that the blue-chip stocks in general were hit by profit-taking over concerns that London shares will continue posting declines and the uncertainty over sterling given that Mr. Lawson 's successor , John Major , had only been in the job one day . Besides British Gas , British Steel skidded 1.74 to 123.5 on turnover of 11 million shares . British Petroleum fell 5 to 286 on 14 million shares traded . Dealers said the multinational oil company was pressured by recent brokerage recommendations urging investors to switch into Shell Trading amp Transport . Shell eased 1 to 416 on turnover of 4.8 million shares . Among the other actively traded blue-chip issues , Imperial Chemical Industries dropped 11 to # 10.86 , Hanson skidded 9.5 to 200.5 , and British Telecom fell 10 to 250 . In Tokyo , stocks closed lower but above intraday lows in active trading . The Nikkei index was pressured down by profit-taking triggered by sharp advances made through this week and fell 151.20 points to 35527.29 . In early trading in Tokyo Monday , the Nikkei index fell 148.85 points to 35378.44 . On Friday , the Tokyo stock price index of first section issues was down 15.82 at 2681.76 . First-section volume was estimated at 1.3 billion shares , up from 886 million shares Thursday . An official at Wako Securities said brokerages ' excessive expectations about recent advances in Tokyu Group shares and real estate issues were dashed Friday . Dealers placed heavy buy orders in the morning to start the first trading day for November transactions . But they failed to sell these stocks to client investors , who were cautious about the sharp gains these issues made this week , the Wako official said . Fund managers said Friday 's profittaking was a natural result of the week 's " abnormal fever " in buying real estate , shipbuilding , steel and construction shares . Frankfurt prices closed lower again Friday , the fourth decline in the past five days and the culmination of a week that saw the DAX index lose 4 % . The DAX dropped 19.69 points Friday to 1462.93 . Traders said the continued turbulence in other markets , coupled with the drop in London following the Lawson resignation , were responsible . Traders said that selling pressure was n't enormous and that the DAX dropped Friday more on a lack of any substantial buying interest . They said contributing to the downward drift was the fact that many professional traders had chosen to square positions ahead of the weekend . " It 's the whole uncertainty about what 's happening around us , " said Valentin Von Korff , a trader at Credit Suisse First Boston in Frankfurt . " If you take away the outside influences , the market itself looks very cheap . What 's happening here is n't justified by the fundamentals . " Traders said the market remains extremely nervous because of the wild swings seen on the New York Stock Exchange last week . That 's leaving small investors with cold feet , they said , and prompting institutions to take a reserved stance on the sidelines as well , at least until the market in New York settles down somewhat . Elsewhere , share prices closed lower in Paris , Zurich , Amsterdam , Brussels and Stockholm , and were mixed in Milan . The British shakeup was widely cited for the declines . Share prices also closed lower in Sydney , Hong Kong , Singapore , Taipei , Manila , Wellington and Seoul . Concern about declines in other markets , especially New York , caused selling pressure . Here are price trends on the world 's major stock markets , as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective , Geneva . To make them directly comparable , each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100 . The percentage change is since year-end .</p><h3>Causal Relations                 with events defined as verb or nouns (Mirza's work):</h3><table border="1" class="dataframe">
