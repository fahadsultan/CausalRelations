Sales rose 6.2 % to $ 1.45 billion from $ 1.37 billion . After a flat second quarter tied largely to lower newsprint earnings , Kimberly - Clark attributed the gain to improved results in its consumer businesses in North America , Brazil and Korea . Those gains came from higher prices , particularly for disposable diapers and tissue products , and from increased sales , primarily for feminine-care products , the company said . Newsprint results <span style='background:yellow'>continued</span> to be depressed , the company added , because of industrywide price <span style='background:yellow'>discounting</span> .
